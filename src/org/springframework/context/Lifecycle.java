 * Interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in
 * a Spring BeanFactory) and containers (typically a Spring ApplicationContext).
 * Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that apply.
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the MBeanExporter will typically be defined with an
 * InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler, restricting the visibility of
 * activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle interface.
